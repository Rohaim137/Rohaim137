# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Rohaim, a computer science student at FAST NUCES Lahore.

📚 Currently learning the basics of machine learning, I'm on a mission to blend theoretical knowledge gained over the years with hands-on experience. While my project portfolio may be limited for now, I'm a passionate learner eagerly exploring different realms of computer science.
