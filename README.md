### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, wonderful people of the tech world! I'm Muhammad Rohaim, a computer science student at FAST NUCES Lahore.

ðŸ“š Currently navigating the exciting landscape of computer science academia, I'm on a mission to blend theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. While my project portfolio may be limited for now, I'm a passionate learner eagerly exploring the realms of app development.

ðŸ’» Working diligently on a full-stack web app, I'm diving into the intricacies of front-end design and back-end logic. The thrill of connecting the dots between client and server keeps me motivated, and I'm excited to see this project evolve.

ðŸŒ± As a perpetual student, I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it's mastering new programming languages, understanding algorithms, or exploring the latest tech trends, count me in for the challenge!

ðŸŽ“ Let's connect and learn together!
